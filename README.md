# Chessboard on OpenGL
## Introduction 
The goal of the project is to create a simple chessboard with pieces and visualize it in OpenGL. It's possible to change the materials of both the chessboard and the pieces.
## Technologies
● Blender: to model the chessboard and the pieces and to assign default materials that could be
changed in OpenGL. </br>
● OpenGL: For rendering the 3D chessboard and its components.</br>
● Assimp: For importing the .fbx file in OpenGL.</br>
● GLFW: For window and input handling.</br>
● GLAD: For managing OpenGL function pointers.</br>
● GLM: For mathematical operations like matrix transformations.</br>
● ImGui: For the user interface.</br>
● C++: For the overall implementation and logic of the program.</br>
